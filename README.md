# BatchBlenderToUnity
Python script for Blender 2.8 for batch exporting models to Unity.

* Works with Blender 2.8
* Exports selected objects as separate files to predefined path (you have to edit the path in the script)
* Correctly applies transforms (scale and rotation in Unity is as it should be)

I claim no resposibility for corrupted blender files. Back up your project and use it at your own risk.
